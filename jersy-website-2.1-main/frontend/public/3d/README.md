# 3D Models Directory

Place your 3D jersey model files here.

## Supported Formats

- **GLTF** (`.gltf`) - Recommended
- **GLB** (`.glb`) - Recommended (binary GLTF, smaller file size)

## File Naming

- Default model: `shirt.glb` or `shirt.gltf`
- The component will look for `/3d/shirt.glb` by default

## Model Requirements

- Low-poly (< 5000 triangles)
- Proper UV mapping for texture application
- File size < 500 KB for optimal performance
- Textures should be embedded or referenced correctly

See `frontend/3D_MODEL_README.md` for detailed instructions on how to integrate a 3D model.
